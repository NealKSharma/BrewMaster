## Architecture & Implementation

This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern for clear separation of concerns:

- **Models** encapsulate data entities, validation rules, and business logic  
- **Views** use Razor pages to render the UI dynamically  
- **Controllers** handle requests, orchestrate data flow, and call the centralized Database Helper for all ADO.NET operations  
- **Database Helper** abstracts and manages connections, commands, and parameter binding

## Technology Stack

| Layer        | Technologies                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Backend      | C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, ADO.NET, SQL Server      |
| Frontend     | HTML, CSS (custom theme), JavaScript, jQuery |
| Security     | SHA256 + salt hashing, parameterized queries, client/server validation, role-based auth  |
| Tooling      | Visual Studio, SQL Server Management Studio    |

---

## Development Highlights

- Migrated from ASP.NET Web Forms to ASP.NET Core MVC for modern architecture and as a learning experience 
- Extensive AJAX interactions for admin operations and cart management  
- Responsive UI with consistent dark brown and gold theme and flexible grid layouts  
- Robust image handling: stored as byte arrays, crash issues resolved in ADO.NET binding  
- Centralized logging for transparency and real-time debugging  

---

## Database Design

The database schema includes:

- **Users** table for account details and securely hashed passwords  
- **Products** table with product metadata and binary image storage  
- **Orders** table to manage checkout data  
- **Logs** tables capturing logins, errors, user updates, and product updates  
- Indexes, primary and foreign keys, ensure performance and integrity.

**A full setup script with sample data is provided.**

## Setup

1. Prerequisites: SQL Server and Visual Studio (ASP.NET workload)

2. To set up the database, run DatabaseSetup.sql in SSMS. This creates all the tables, stored procedures, and triggers for the database titled "BrewMaster"

3. In appsettings.json, update:
   "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=BrewMaster;User Id=sa;Password=YourPass;"

4. Open BrewMaster.sln in Visual Studio and run the application

5. Upon the first launch, you will have to create a user and an admin account for testing. Click on SignUp and create two accounts with different usernames. Initially, both accounts will have user access.

6. Grant Admin in SSMS:
   UPDATE tblUserMaster set UserRole = 'Admin' Where UserId = 1
   OR
   UPDATE tblUserMaster set UserRole = 'Admin' Where UserName = 'username_you_chose'

7. The website will now be set up with dummy products using the same placeholder images.
If you wish to change these placeholder images, log in with the admin account and go to the Product Management page. Then, click on a product, add an image, and update it.
